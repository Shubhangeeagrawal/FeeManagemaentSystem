# FeeManagementSystem
This repository contains C++ code for a simple Student Fee Management System. The system consists of two main modules:

*Student Master Module: Allows users to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on student records. Users can add new student records, view existing records, delete records, search for specific records, and update student information.

*Fee Master Module: Handles fee-related operations such as adding fee records, displaying fee records, deleting fee records, searching for specific fee records, and updating fee information.

Both modules utilize file handling for data storage. The student and fee records are stored in separate binary files (student.dat and fee.dat, respectively).

The user interface is text-based and navigated via a menu-driven approach. Users can choose options from the main menu to access different functionalities within each module.
